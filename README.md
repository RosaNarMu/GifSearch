# GifSearch

Made by Rosa Narváez Muñoz, December 2021.

This React app allows the user to search gifs via Giphy.

## Repository

https://github.com/RosaNarMu/GifSearch

## Installation

1. In order to get a local copy up and running you will need to clone the repo and then install the NPM packages.

```
git clone https://github.com/RosaNarMu/GifSearch
```
2. Then, install the NPM packages

```
npm install
```
3. Finally, you will need to create a .env file in the gif-search folder. There you can place your own API key
from [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api) under the name REACT_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY

```

```
